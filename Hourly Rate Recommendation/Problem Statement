A sample data file is provided which contains
information about "recommendations".  A "recommendation" is the group
of Taskers from which the Client can choose one to book. In this
sample data, each recommendation can have up to 15 Taskers shown.

We want to understand what makes a Client choose a
Tasker. In particular, use market data to build a model
that suggests hourly rates to Taskers that would maximize their
opportunity to be hired.

The columns are as follows:

 recommendation_id    unique identifier for this recommendation, or set of taskers shown
 timestamp            when this recommendation was shown to the client
 tasker_id            unique identifier for the Tasker
 position             the position of the Tasker in the recommendation set, 1 - first, 2 - second, etc.
 hourly_rate          the hourly rate for the Tasker when they were shown
 num_completed_tasks  the number of Tasks the Tasker had completed in that category, when they were shown
 hired                was the Tasker hired or not?  Only 1 tasker out of a set of recommendations can be hired
 category             the category of work the Client needs help with
